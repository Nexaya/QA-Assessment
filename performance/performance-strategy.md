# Performance Testing Strategy for API

**Objective**:  
To evaluate the API's ability to handle high traffic and ensure that it performs well under load.

**Tools**:  
- **JMeter** for simulating concurrent users and API requests.
- **Grafana/Prometheus** for monitoring response time, CPU usage, memory, and other metrics.

**Metrics to Monitor**:
- **Response Time**: Measure the time taken for each request.
- **Throughput**: Number of requests processed per second.
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests.
- **CPU & Memory Usage**: Monitor server resource consumption during load.

**Test Design**:
- Simulate 500, 1000, and 2000 concurrent users making API requests.
- Identify bottlenecks by monitoring performance over time.
